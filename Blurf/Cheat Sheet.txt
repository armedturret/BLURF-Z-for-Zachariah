The cheat sheet has the following format:

<pathID>:
	Text: <text>
		<choiceText> -> <destinationPathID>
		<choiceText> -> <destinationPathID>

What it means :

	pathID: Something the text engine uses to discriminate a path from others.Use ctrl + f to find a specific pathID.

	text : The text that tells the story for that specific path.

	choiceText : What the user has to type.

	destinationPathID : What pathID the engine attempts to find.


How to trace the story : All you have to do to trace a story is to first find a path with a pathID of "start" then look at the text and then the choices and what paths they lead to.Then find that pathID in the document and repeat until desired outcome.The reverse can also be done to start from the end to find a path to the begining.
